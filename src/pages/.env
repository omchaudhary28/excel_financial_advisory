# IMPORTANT: Replace the URL below with your actual InfinityFree website address.
# This should be the public URL where your PHP backend files are accessible.
# Example: http://your-infinityfree-domain.com/
# Do NOT use sqlxxx.infinityfree.com (that is the database server, not the web server).
# THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP FOR YOUR FRONTEND TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR BACKEND.
